### Some notes

- You can edit the style on the CSS file or inline at TS file. (Us ` for multiple code lines)

- To use a component as an atribute you have to use [your-component] at @component_selector. Than you just call something like 
```html
<div your-component></div>
```


## CLI important comands:
ng g c <name of component>
